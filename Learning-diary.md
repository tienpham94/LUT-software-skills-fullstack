### LEARNING DIARY - MODULE

### 21.6.2020

####  NodeJS
I chose to use VSCode since I have a lot of experience using it in real work life. For me, it is easy to use and definitely the best editor out there for web application development. It is very popular in the web dev community, completely open source.
I have node.js installed, Node v12.14.0
I also have git installed, and I use MacOS.
I also learned that REPL is Read Eval Print Loop.

I have some experience working with Node.js in the past. I revised that Node.js  is a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. Node.js is Javascript running on the server. It is used to build powerful, fast and scalable web applications, uses an event-driven, non-blokcing I/O model

I also learned that the event loop is single-threaded, supports concurrency via events and callbacks. EvevntEmitter class is used to bind events and event listeners.

We can build a lot of things with Node.js. REST APIs and backend applications for example. Also real-time services, blogs, CMS, Social Applications, utilities and tools, and any thing that is not CPU-intensive

I also relearned that NPM is Node.js package manager, which is used to install node programs/modules. It is easy to specify and link dependencies. I learned that modules get installed into "node_modules" folder by running 

```
npm install express

or to install globally

npm install -g express
```
